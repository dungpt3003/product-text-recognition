# Text Recognition on Products
Project for text recognition on images of industrial products using EAST text detector.

## Introduction
OpenCVâ€™s EAST (Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detection) text detector is a deep learning model, based on a novel architecture and training pattern. It is capable of:

- running at near real-time at 13 FPS on 720p images and
- obtains state-of-the-art text detection accuracy.

## Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
- To run the detector on a single image:

 `python text_recognition.py --east frozen_east_text_detection.pb --image images/example_01.jpg`
